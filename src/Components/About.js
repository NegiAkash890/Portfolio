          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi there! I am Akash! You might also know me as Game Changer. I've
            been coding for over 2 years now. As a  developer I've
            worked both with startups and large corporations to help build &
            scale their companies. Along the journey I realised my passion
            existed in helping others excel and pursue their dreams as upcoming
            developers. With this passion, I have now trained thousand's of
            developers across the globe. Through live coaching sessions on
            Youtube, I have accumulated several MILLION views demonstrating how
            to apply developer skills in a range of cool builds and challenges.
            I deliver REAL VALUE by teaching REAL WORLD projects to help
            students enter the world of web development. Youâ€™ll get hands-on
            experience and learn the skills that are required to succeed in the
            real-world in this community.
